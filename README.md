✅ README.md – Placement Prediction App

# 🎓 Placement Prediction App

A simple machine learning web app built using Streamlit to predict whether a student is likely to be placed based on their academic performance.

## 📌 About the Project

This project uses a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict placement outcomes based on the following inputs:

- CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
- IQ Score
- Student ID (used as a training feature)

The app is deployed online using Streamlit Cloud.
